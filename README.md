# Overview
 
This repository contains three projects developed as part of the "Tallers de Nous Usos de la Inform√†tica (TNUI)" course at the University of Barcelona. 
The projects showcase different aspects of data science and machine learning, including exploratory data analysis (EDA), recommender systems, and classification using machine learning algorithms. 
Each project utilizes real-world datasets to apply advanced Python tools and techniques.

# Projects

## 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Advanced Python Tools

In this project, we performed a detailed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of NYC taxi rides. 
The goal was to gain insights into the dataset by visualizing key features and identifying patterns or anomalies. 
Advanced Python libraries such as pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and numpy were used for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis.

Key topics:

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, heatmaps)
- Summary statistics and outlier detection

Dataset: NYC Taxi Rides

## 2. Heuristic Recommender System

For this project, we built a heuristic-based recommender system using the MovieLens dataset. 
The system suggests movies to users based on their previous ratings and preferences, using similarity measures and basic recommendation algorithms.

Key topics:

- Content-based filtering
- Similarity metrics (e.g., cosine similarity)
- User-item interaction matrix

Dataset: MovieLens (Movie ratings and movies)

## 3. Naive Bayes Classification with Tweets

In this project, we built a text classification model using the Naive Bayes algorithm to classify tweets into different categories. 
The dataset was preprocessed and cleaned, and we explored different techniques for tokenization and feature extraction. The Naive Bayes classifier was then used to classify tweets into predefined categories.

Key topics:

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal)
- Feature extraction (TF-IDF, Bag of Words)
- Naive Bayes classification

Dataset: Twitter data (tweets)
